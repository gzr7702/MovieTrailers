DESCRIPTION:

This is an application that creates a page to display the posters, stars and trailers of some of my favorite movies.

CONTENTS:

README: This file
movies.py: The Movie model and functions that create the movie objects
fresh_tomatoes.py: The script that creates the movie objects and creates the web page

INSTALLATION:

The application uses Python 2.7 and two external libraries: BeautifulSoup and IMDb. You can install Beautiful soup by running: 

pip install beautifulsoup

Or, you can go to the following site, download the package and follow the instructions there.

IMDb can be installed by running: pip install IMDbPY

Or, going to the following site and following the installation instructions:

http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/downloads.html

USE:

Once you have these libraries installed, run the command:

python movies.py

It will create a file called movie_trailers.html and pass that file to a lightweight webserver to serve the page
on the local machine.
